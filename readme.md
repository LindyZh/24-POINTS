# Important Stuff

This is just a mini 24 points game/game-cheater built with python and PYQT5 Module (inspired by Q5 2020 U of T ESC190 final exam).  

Here are something that you may need to know a little bit to completely understand this program:

1. OOP in python
2. PYQT5
3. json (a tiny little bit)
4. threading

Background info regarding details of the game can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game). Noticed that the game does allow a bit more flexibility than the traditional 24 point card game ~~so hopefully it's a bit more fun~~. 

# To run the game

​		Simply use python to compile the **main.py** file and you'll see the home page popping up. Note that you must have python and [pyqt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) installed. If the logo pics are not loading it means there's something wrong with the resource file so maybe check locations of **resource_rc.py** and the bin folder (both should be under the same directory as main.py). This is just a really short personal project so pls don't fuss over every single little details... 

​		If you are really intrigued by the game you can also have it downloaded locally as an executable file using [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html), which I believe is compatible for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
